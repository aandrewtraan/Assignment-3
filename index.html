            <h2>Team Friday</h2>

            <h3>Tom (s3948171)</h3>
                <p>My name is Tom and I come from a Vietnamese background and my personal hobbies to do during my spare time is to surf the web or to watch videos on youtube. Web design is the part about IT that I am the most interested in and it’s also my most enjoyable part about the component. Although I have no actual personal experience in designing a website myself, personally I have tried to create some before through third party websites like skillshare and shopify which allow users to easily create websites.</p>

                <p>These results from the three tests that I have done mean that I should try to adjust my daily life to help improve on these aspects of my personality and to further improve my way of life in the future through the suggested trait that Has been given to me through the 16 personality tests.</p>

            <h3>Tommy (s3942383)</h3>
                <p>My name is Tommy and I am half Vietnamese and Half Chinese second generation Australian. My interest in IT is web design and technical support. This is because the looks and coding of websites look very interesting and seeing it be used will be so satisfying to me. Technical support is basically the job at my own house already as my parents being older and coming from Vietnam, do not understand technology like I do so anything that happens that affects technology it is up to me to fix it.</p>

                <p>These results for me if I am being honest do not mean anything for me at all. That is because I do not believe in these tests to be 100% accurate to the person that is taking them, although it is just a general idea of the person, it means nothing to me at all as a person can change easily from one personality to the other. It shows me that the Virtuoso loves to learn with his hands building things, although that is sometimes true for me. Some days I rather just sit back and let my brain do the work. Overall these tests mean nothing to me and I just live with my personality day to day.
                </p>

            <h3>Tri (s3947389)</h3>
                <p>My name is Tri and I am Vietnamese and Australian. My fascination in IT stems from an ingrained passion in coding and constructing websites. Being able to program and create lines of code that can be used to create a multitude of interfaces that aim to maximise and implement a more efficient lifestyle.</p>

                <p>In my opinion, a person's personality shouldn’t be defined by personality tests as they are only partially accurate and only provide a general idea of what the person’s personality is like. So to me, these tests don’t mean much and therefore I don’t give too much thought about them.</p>

            <h3>Sahan (s3943554)</h3>
                <p>My name is Sahan Malagala. I am a full-time student studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia. I was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Australia in 2006. My interest in Information Technology arises from my experience using technology every day. I have been interested in Information Technology ever since I was in primary school, and I have always been a fan of this Industry. I use information technology for many purposes. For instance, I use my laptop and phone for online shopping, as it makes it more convenient to purchase products. Through my daily use of social media, I stay connected with people that mean most to me in my life. I have also used information technology for educational purposes such as research for school projects. From experiences like those I have stated, I have learned that Information Technology is very important for not just me, but for the whole world.</p>

                <p>The results from these three tests might influence my behaviour in a team because it will allow me to think about the strengths that I have such as my intuition and my assertiveness. I think the results say I would use more visual methods of learning when working with my team. I believe my teammates would find me easy to communicate with and easy to work effectively with. I know that emotional stability and communication is very crucial for collaborative projects. I think my results show that I will behave well in a team, and I would make a great positive impact on the members in my group. I think that I will help my team achieve our goals and at the end of our work, we will be in a great position.</p>

            <h3>Andrew (s3946048)</h3>
                <p>My name is Andrew and I was born in Australia but my parents were born in Vietnam. In my household, we speak both English and Vietnamese. My interest in IT grew as technology advanced over the years. The world relies on technology, information, and data; so I wanted to understand more about it. I guess I was always interested ever since I was young. Even though at that time I didn't even know of the term 'IT', I was fascinated by technology and what it could accomplish.</p>

                <p>Personally, the test results don't really mean anything to me. It's essentially telling me things I already knew about myself but in a more formal way with more words. The results themselves are not going to affect my behaviour in a team, but it's my actual personality that determines my behaviour in a group environment. Although, it did remind me of how reserved I am and my ability, or lack thereof, in socialising. But my skills in socialising differ depending on the siutation. I can be quite talkative with friends that share many interests with me, but I heavily struggle to converse with new people. I guess what I can take from this is the fact that I should try putting myself out there a bit more so I can come out of my shell, but that's easier said than done.</p>

            <h3>Ayrtaan (s3943294)</h3>
                <p>My name is Ayrtaan Sadirov, I am an ethnic Uyghur and an Australian Citizen. I can speak English fluently and Uyghur semi-fluently and I enjoy playing basketball and some video games. My main interests in I.T would have to do with Cyber-security and Machine-learning. I am very interested in becoming a white-hat hacker, which is a hacker that is hired by companies to test their security by attempting to breach them. I’ve always had a vague interest in I.T, but they have recently become more specific and clear.</p>

                <p>I think the results from my personality tests shows I am an empathic person and usually understands and tries to work with other people. I am a Tactile learner which means I learn the best from a hands on approach and doing things myself.</p>

            <h3>Career Plans</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tom - Web Designer/Developer</li>
                    <li>Tommy - IT Technician</li>
                    <li>Tri - Software Engineer</li>
                    <li>Sahan - Cyber Security Analyst, Graphic Designer or Network Engineer</li>
                    <li>Andrew Tran - Java Developer</li>
                    <li>Ayrtaan - Cyber security / Threat Analysis, or Java Developer</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A Java developer, web designer/developer, and software engineer are all similar in terms of the fact that the job ‘produces’ something. They require knowledge with a variety of coding languages such as: HTML, CSS, Java, Python, SQL, PHP, etc. Experience with topics such as UI design, database modelling, web frameworks, API, etc are common amongst these jobs.</p>

                <p>Cyber security/threat analyst all require knowledge with cyber security and experience with things such as: SIEM technologies, log management, vulnerability assessment and management, Security information and management software.</p>

                <p>A Graphic designer is the most different between all the jobs. They don’t require too much technical knowledge with I.T, but more so with topics related to modern design principles. Jobs like these also require a more creative and abstract mind. Although they still need experience and knowledge with certain graphic design softwares such as: Adobe Creative Suite/InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.</p>

                <p>An IT Technician is a much more broad job that would require basic knowledge with a variety of Information Technology topics. Depending on the company, the job may require experience in different sorts of hardware and software. Though, this job is a lot more hands on as they generally work more on hardware.</p>

                <p>Although these jobs have clear differences between each other, they all still fall under the category of Information Technology. One way or the other, in any of these jobs, required knowledge and experience would overlap with other jobs, with some more than others.</p>

            <div class="overview"> 
                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <h3>Topic</h3>
                    <p>For our project we have decided as a group that we are gonna be creating a food app that allow people to locate restaurants around the area. It differs from other apps such as Uber Eats because it is not a delivery service, but a service to find good food, whether you’re in a new part of town or if you just happen to be an indecisive person. Based on preferences from the user, the app will then choose a restaurant nearby that matches those preferences in order to recommend a place for them to eat.</p>

                <h3>Motivation</h3>  
                    <p>Motivation for this project stems from the annoying indecisiveness that is rather common among people when choosing a place to eat. Either no one unanimously agrees on a restaurant, or no one can think of any particular restaurant. An app that can choose a place for you can significantly cut down the time it takes for people to decide.</p>

                <h3>Landscape</h3>
                    <p>There are similar apps such as 'Yelp', 'OpenTable', and 'Tripadvisor'. These are the most popular apps for locating restaurants. They provide the ability to search for nearby restaurants under filters that the user can add. Users can also directly schedule bookings through the app. However, none of these apps provide the ability to directly provide restaurant recommendations to users based on their preferences. This does not solve our problem where one would struggle to pick a certain restaurant in the first place.</p>

            <h2>Detailed Description</h2>

            <h3>Aims</h3>

            <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

            <h3>Roles</h3>

            <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
                <p>Our project Idea known as “Yumi” is a non-profit app with the essential utilisation of the already well developed google map to allow users to find unique/hidden gems around their area that they may have interest in visiting.</p>

                <p>We intend to develop a usable interface application that can successfully show users their location by using the GPS software already installed into their devices, which will allow our application to locate restaurants within their area that matches their preferences. We plan to use an A.I that will be able to pick out restaurants that correlate with the user's liking through machine learning/deep learning.</p>

                <h4>Scope:</h4>
                    <p>“Yumi” will not be an application that will include other spots other than restaurants that we have determined to match with the preference of the user when they created their account , this is to prevent people using our application in any malicious way to ruin the experience for other users.</p>

                    <p>Google map is the main open map application that is used within “Yumi” to allow the A.I system to navigate the user to their desired restaurant, before wishing them a good meal through a notification before exiting the google map application.</p>

                    <p>Our application “Yumi” will have the function of showing user different and unique restaurant through the use of the location that the user must enable within their setting of their electronic devices. which will enable our application to show them the restaurant with the best rated review within their area up till 10 km of where they are currently located, the restaurant will also include photos as well as past customer review about their experience with the restaurant base on our rating system of experience,service,quality and cost.</p>

                    <p>When the app notices the user leaving the restaurant, it will send a notification to their phone, surveying them on how they enjoyed the food. It will simply be a ranking out of ten. If the user doesn’t open the notification, the app would simply ask them again the very next time they open the app. If the user chooses to complete the survey, the app will store this information and use it in the future.</p>

                    <p>The app will become more accurate the more information the user provides. For more casual and secretive users, the app will try to get them to turn on their locations or tell them their favourite restaurants by sending them a notification every once in a while, telling them that their experience with the app will become enhanced if they do. We will be careful not to over-step the legal boundaries regarding information/privacy and will hold a very high ethical standard with this app, taking the privacy of the user very seriously. We will take great care in ensuring that the process is as quick and easy as possible by having an easy to manage U.I.</p>

                <h4>Limit:</h4>
                    <p>Some of the limits/obstacles that we might face during the development of our application would be the development of the A.I that we are going to be using for the application. This is because most of us do not have a lot of experience in the field of A.I, thus creating one would be the biggest issue for our team.</p>

                    <p>Another obstacle/limit might be the lack of time available to us for the ideas that we want to integrate into our application, which may take a lot more time then the time that has been allocated to complete the project,which may result in someone aspect of the application not being detail as we would like appearing in our final application of “Yumi”.</p>
                

            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                <p>Figma will be used to design the prototype for the project. Google maps will be used as navigation in the app, so that the user can find a restaurant close to them that they wish to eat at. Mobile phones will be required because they are portable and much more likely to be used than other devices.  Users must turn on the “precise location” option on their mobile phones, in order for the app to accurately find the user’s location. Laptop and desktop computers with a minimum of 8GB RAM will be used to develop and manufacture the restaurant-finding application. A software that is necessary for this project is “WebStorm Version 2022.11” which is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for JavaScript. JavaScript will be a necessary language for this project considering the restaurant-finding application will be a mobile application.</p>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>To test our prototype for the application we plan to select different 5 random people to conduct a survey using a model of the application that has limited function to gather their opinion on the application about it useability and interface so that we can further improve the application to be able to attract more user, and develop “Yumi” into a more user friendly application that is easy to navigate.</p>

                <p>Our team will also be conducting functional testing and loading testing to ensure that our application is programmed to function as it’s supposed to be and no malfunctioning/error will be present during the final steps. These tests are also to ensure that we can improve on the application if some of the programming are miscalculated or an unexpected human error occurred that was not aware to any of us, these test will ensure that such thing will be fix before we reach the final step of the application so that no mishap occur.</p>

            <h3>Timeframe</h3>

            <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>Figma is the collaborative interface design tool that will be used to design a prototype for our restaurant searching app. There could be trouble for group members when using Figma, since a few of them have barely any experience with the tool. Creating the prototype could be difficult considering it will take a lot of work to make sure the design is satisfactory and contains all the vital information such as the buttons and menus. It is risky to design a prototype that the target users would not desire. The prototype must be visually appealing, otherwise the customers would not be inclined to use the restaurant searching application. If the prototype is not presented pleasingly, then the group members would risk wasting time and effort on creating an unwanted design.</p>

                <p>A risk would be making mistakes with the website for the assignment. For instance, group members can make errors with the coding aspect, which would consequently affect the assignment.  Another risk is planning inadequately. The group members must be punctual and not risk working past deadlines. All tasks should be finished on time and according to schedule. Another risk is poor communication. In group assignments it is crucial for all members to be informed of all necessary details regarding the assignment at all times. Members should have their notification for Teams turned on so that they can communicate effectively and avoid risking failing the assignment. Meetings and group discussions are important, and they should be frequent so everyone in the group is kept up to date on the progress of the assignment.</p>

            <h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>
                <p>Communication is extremely important for this assignment as it will be one of the biggest factors of the group’s success. Communication within the group will take place online and in real life. The group will meet up once a week on Fridays during their “Introduction To Technology” 10.30am tutorial and discuss their progress with each other. When communicating online, the group will utilise Canvas, Discord and Teams. Primarily Discord and Teams will be used since most of the group are fonder of these applications. There will be communication on these platforms via text and video calls. Meetings will take place once a week (if possible), and texts will be sent whenever necessary. All group members must be active and contribute effectively to the engaging discussions about the assignment. Canvas will be used as a backup option in case something happens with the other applications and if urgent communication between members is necessary. If a group member does not respond to any communication from the group, then they will be reported to the tutor and/or the course coordinator of “Introduction To Information Technology”, and hopefully the member eventually ends up participating in the assignment.</p>
