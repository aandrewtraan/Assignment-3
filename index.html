            <h3>Tom (s3948171)</h3>
                <p>My name is Tom and I come from a Vietnamese background and my personal hobbies to do during my spare time is to surf the web or to watch videos on youtube. Web design is the part about IT that I am the most interested in and it’s also my most enjoyable part about the component. Although I have no actual personal experience in designing a website myself, personally I have tried to create some before through third party websites like skillshare and shopify which allow users to easily create websites.</p>

                <p>These results from the three tests that I have done mean that I should try to adjust my daily life to help improve on these aspects of my personality and to further improve my way of life in the future through the suggested trait that Has been given to me through the 16 personality tests.</p>

            <h3>Tommy (s3942383)</h3>
                <p>My name is Tommy and I am half Vietnamese and Half Chinese second generation Australian. My interest in IT is web design and technical support. This is because the looks and coding of websites look very interesting and seeing it be used will be so satisfying to me. Technical support is basically the job at my own house already as my parents being older and coming from Vietnam, do not understand technology like I do so anything that happens that affects technology it is up to me to fix it.</p>

                <p>These results for me if I am being honest do not mean anything for me at all. That is because I do not believe in these tests to be 100% accurate to the person that is taking them, although it is just a general idea of the person, it means nothing to me at all as a person can change easily from one personality to the other. It shows me that the Virtuoso loves to learn with his hands building things, although that is sometimes true for me. Some days I rather just sit back and let my brain do the work. Overall these tests mean nothing to me and I just live with my personality day to day.</p>

            <h3>Tri (s3947389)</h3>
                <p>My name is Tri and I am Vietnamese and Australian. My fascination in IT stems from an ingrained passion in coding and constructing websites. Being able to program and create lines of code that can be used to create a multitude of interfaces that aim to maximise and implement a more efficient lifestyle.</p>

                <p>In my opinion, a person's personality shouldn’t be defined by personality tests as they are only partially accurate and only provide a general idea of what the person’s personality is like. So to me, these tests don’t mean much and therefore I don’t give too much thought about them.</p>

            <h3>Sahan (s3943554)</h3>
                <p>My name is Sahan Malagala. I am a full-time student studying Bachelor of Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia. I was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Australia in 2006. My interest in Information Technology arises from my experience using technology every day. I have been interested in Information Technology ever since I was in primary school, and I have always been a fan of this Industry. I use information technology for many purposes. For instance, I use my laptop and phone for online shopping, as it makes it more convenient to purchase products. Through my daily use of social media, I stay connected with people that mean most to me in my life. I have also used information technology for educational purposes such as research for school projects. From experiences like those I have stated, I have learned that Information Technology is very important for not just me, but for the whole world.</p>

                <p>The results from these three tests might influence my behaviour in a team because it will allow me think about the strengths that I have such as my intuition and my assertiveness. I think the results say would use more visual methods of learning when working with my team. I believe my teammates would find me easy to communicate with and easy to work effectively with. I know that emotional stability and communication is very crucial for collaborative projects. I think my results show that I will behave well in a team, and I would make a great positive impact on the members in my group. I think that I will help my team achieve our goals and at the end of our work, we will be in a great position.</p>

            <h3>Andrew (s3946048)</h3>
                <p>My name is Andrew and I was born in Australia but my parents were born in Vietnam. In my household, we speak both English and Vietnamese. My interest in IT grew as technology advanced over the years. The world relies on technology, information, and data; so I wanted to understand more about it. I guess I was always interested ever since I was young. Even though at that time I didn't even know of the term 'IT', I was fascinated by technology and what it could accomplish.</p>

                <p>Personally, the test results don't really mean anything to me. It's essentially telling me things I already knew about myself but in a more formal way with more words. The results themselves are not going to affect my behaviour in a team, but it's my actual personality that determines my behaviour in a group environment. Although, it did remind me of how reserved I am and my ability, or lack thereof, in socialising. But my skills in socialising differ depending on the siutation. I can be quite talkative with friends that share many interests with me, but I heavily struggle to converse with new people. I guess what I can take from this is the fact that I should try putting myself out there a bit more so I can come out of my shell, but that's easier said than done.</p>

            <h3>Ayrtaan (s3943294)</h3>
                <p>My name is Ayrtaan Sadirov, I am an ethnic Uyghur and an Australian Citizen. I can speak English fluently and Uyghur semi-fluently and I enjoy playing basketball and some video games. My main interests in I.T would have to do with Cyber-security and Machine-learning. I am very interested in becoming a white-hat hacker, which is a hacker that is hired by companies to test their security by attempting to breach them. I’ve always had a vague interest in I.T, but they have recently become more specific and clear.</p>

                <p>I think the results from my personality tests shows I am an empathic person and usually understands and tries to work with other people. I am a Tactile learner which means I learn the best from a hands on approach and doing things myself.</p>

                <h3>Topic</h3>
                    <p>For our project we have decided as a group that we are gonna be creating a food app that allow people to locate restaurants around the area. It differs from other apps such as Uber Eats because it is not a delivery service, but a service to find good food, whether you’re in a new part of town or if you just happen to be an indecisive person. Based on preferences from the user, the app will then choose a restaurant nearby that matches those preferences in order to recommend a place for them to eat.</p>

                <h3>Motivation</h3>  
                    <p>Motivation for this project stems from the annoying indecisiveness that is rather common among people when choosing a place to eat. Either no one unanimously agrees on a restaurant, or no one can think of any particular restaurant. An app that can choose a place for you can significantly cut down the time it takes for people to decide.</p>
